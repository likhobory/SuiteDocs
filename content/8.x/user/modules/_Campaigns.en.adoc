= Campaigns

== Overview

The Campaign Module in SuiteCRM can be used to send and track different types of Emails, such as Marketing, Transactional and Survey,
to selected Targets (Users, Contacts, Targets, Leads & Accounts).

With the tracking tools built into the Campaign Module, you can monitor the response you receive from your Campaign in real time.
Allowing you to view recipient activity with your Campaign, such as those that view the email, click through and any blocked Emails.

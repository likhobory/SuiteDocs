The `Two Factor Configuration` button will bring you to the page to enable Two-Factor Authentication.

After enabling a set of Recovery/ Backup codes will show.

=== What are Recovery/ Backup Codes?

Backup codes are one time codes that can be used when you are unable to log in with your authenticator app.
After using a code once you will *not* be able to use it again.

The 10 Backup Codes will only show *after* verifying your authentication code and will *not* show again when revisiting the page.

=== Regenerating Backup Codes

You can regenerate backup codes via the Two-Factor Configuration page.
You will have to re-enter your authenticator code.

Admins can also disable the 2FA for users via their profile. If the user has 2FA enabled a new "Disable 2FA" action will appear for Admin users, that will allow Admins to disable 2FA for that user.

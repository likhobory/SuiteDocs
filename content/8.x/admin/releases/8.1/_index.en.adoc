{{% /notice %}}

==== icon:warning[] Important Upgrade Notes

* New entries were added to the config. Please make sure to run `Rebuild Config File` located in the Administration > Repair menu
* Php session_gc is now force enabled by default.
** This option can be disabled by setting enable within the session_gc array to false in config.php
** The values for session.gc_probability and session.gc_divisor can be changed in the following config.php entries within the session_gc array
*** gc_probability
*** gc_divisor
** Check php documentation for more information on these settings https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php
** If you are using a session_dir other than the default, please make sure to have session_gc enabled. Otherwise session files won't be cleaned.
** If you are using debian or ubuntu based systems, and you have the default session_dir (which fallsback to the system default),
you may want to set enable within session_gc array to false, as that is the default value for these systems.
They have replacements for the php session_gc. Please review your system’s defaults before making any changes.

{{% notice note %}}
In-app configuration for `session save-path` is not supported yet in SuiteCRM 8. It is scheduled to be added on a future release.

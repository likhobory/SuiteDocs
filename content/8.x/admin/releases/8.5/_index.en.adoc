== 8.5.0

_Released 13/12/2023_

===  icon:check[] Release Notes

==== icon:server[] System Requirement Changes

{{% notice warning %}}
Angular version has been updated to v16. For development purposes you will need to update your dependencies. Please see the SuiteCRM 8.5.x Compatibility Matrix link:../../compatibility-matrix/[here.]
{{% /notice %}}


==== icon:code[] Backward Incompatible Changes

===== Frontend Extension Updates

With the upgrade to angular v16 the version of the `@angular-architects/module-federation` lib has also been updated.

Previously built extensions will need to be updated. Please read the link:../../../developer/extensions/frontend/migration/migration-8.5/[Frontend extension - Migrate to SuiteCRM 8.5+] guide for information on how to upgrade.


==== icon:star[] Enhancements

===== Cache Upgrade

We have added Symfony caching to backend metadata calls. On average this reduces the app metadata graphql calls from 429ms to 323ms.

We have applied several actions that reset the cache which include:

* Saving in User Profile
* Applying Menu Configuration changes
* Saving Password Management changes
* etc...

If there is any reason this might not be working, cache can also be reset by running a `Repair and Rebuild` from within
the `Admin`->`Repair` menu.

===== Quick Filters

Quick Filters have now been added to SuiteCRM 8!

Quick Filters are new option on list view saved filters. They allow easy access to filters and easy switching between frequently used filters (as depicted on the following gif).

To learn more about see the link:../../../features/filters/quick-filters/quick-filters[Quick Filters documentation]

image:quick-filter-demo-docs.gif[Quick Filters Demo]


===== Mobile Adjustments

We have made some minor adjustments to the mobile view, where Insights are now disabled by default.

image:mobile-adjustments.png[Mobile Adjustments]

When Insights are selected it will now show instead of the listview.

To return to listview, you can disable insights.

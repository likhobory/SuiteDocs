==== icon:level-up-alt[] Setup changes


===== icon:server[] New Schedulers Entrypoint

A new entrypoint has been added to run Schedulers.
This is a Symfony command that can be run via the CLI or via a cron job.

----
php bin/console schedulers:run
----

This command will run all the Schedulers that are due to run at the time of execution.

To configure cron jobs, you can use the following command to edit the crontab for the web server user (usually `www-data`):

----
sudo crontab -e -u www-data
----

----
* * * * * [path/to/php] [path/to/suite/instance]/bin/console  schedulers:run > /dev/null 2>&1
----

*(Optional)* Depending on the setup you might need to use the `-e [env]` (e.g. `-e prod`) flag to set the env.


==== icon:book[] Documentation

We have added new documentation for the redesigned Campaigns Module. See more information link:../../../user/modules/_campaigns/[here.]

==== icon:star[] Enhancements

===== icon:paint-brush[] Email Compose Redesign

image:Email-Compose.png[Email-Compose.png]

The Email Compose window has been redesigned in SuiteCRM 8!

From the To, CC and BCC fields you can search and send to SuiteCRM Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Users or individual Emails.

You are able to insert an Email Template which will parse the variables based on the selected Related To record.

The Body field has been updated to use the squire editor, with more options for formatting.

You can select the Email of a record from the List View, Record View or Dashlet, and this will open a new email compose window to the email associated with that record.

===== icon:address-card[] Outbound Email Default

You can now select a Default Outbound Email Account. This will be then be used as the pre-selected Outbound Account when composing a Campaign or Email.

For newly created users, the first personal outbound created will automatically be set as their default. This can be updated via
the "Actions" dropdown on the record.

==== Missing Features

- Attachments in compose modal
- Signature in compose modal
- Attachments in campaigns
- Insert variables button on html editor

==== Known Issues

- Tracker toggle in Admin -> Campaign Settings can show the wrong option selected
- When changing Admin Settings in Admin -> Campaign Settings, the Frontend cache is not fully reloaded
- Multiple clicks of entirely unique Links in a Campaign Email increments the chart for each unique link, rather than just once per Email
- Various Legacy Email Actions will lead to a White Screen. (ie: Quotes -> Email PDF / Emails -> Reply )
- Duplicating and Cancelling on records leads to a Whitescreen
- Duplicating an Email Marketing record does not reset the Queue Status
- Insert Template & Save actions do not work fully when Source Editor is open on the Squire Body
- Survey URLs are converted with a missing http/https header. (ie: When using the $surveys_survey_url_display variable in the template)
- Filtering on a Pre-filtered Multirelate (ie: Campaigns->Target Lists) can show already selected results as blank rows
- On initialization, the Parent Type relate field has issues with selecting records. (ie: On Task Creation). A workaround for this is to switch the related module.
- Setting a new Default Outbound account is not reflected in Campaigns / Compose until symfony and frontend cache are both cleared

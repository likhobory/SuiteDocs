* Fixed code to eliminate warnings/ errors from logs.
* Update missing labels

==== icon:star[] Filtering on Favorites

You can now filter by `Favorites` and `My Items`.

===== icon:key[] Two-Factor Authentication

We have added Two-factor authentication on SuiteCRM 8 using TOTP. See more information link:../../../../8.x/features/two-factor/two-factor[here.]

image:Qr-2FA.png[8.8.0 Enable Two-Factor Authentication]

⚠️ *Important:* **For upgrades from 8.8-beta to 8.8.0 - Two Factor TOTP Secret and Backup Codes are now encoded in the db.
This can cause issues when using 2FA configured in the beta. 2FA might need disabled and re-enabled.**

==== icon:paint-brush[] Record View, Subpanel, Top Widget and Timeline Redesign

image:new-record-view.png[8.8.0 Record View]

* Record View
** The fields within the record view now take up minimal space, allowing you to see the full record.
** The required field indicator has been moved to the left of the field label.

* Subpanels
** Subpanels buttons are now more compact and show the number of records a subpanel has.
** The number of subpanels that show when collapsed is configurable via the `subpanel_buttons_panel_limits.yaml`.
** Although it is recommended to do these changes within `defaultExt` or alternatively your own extension.

* Timeline
** Following the other changes, the timeline is also more compact showing more information on the record without scrolling.

* Top Widget
** The Top Widget has been moved to the insights panel, along with some styling adjustments.

===== Demo Data

SuiteCRM Demo Data has been updated to generate more date and optimized to run faster.

==== icon:cog[] Log file Change

* The log_dir has now been updated to log to `<root>/logs/legacy` instead of `<root>/public/legacy`.
* For upgrade instances:
** The `log_dir` on config.php will be updated to a new path, only if it was using the default path.
** Old log files will not be moved

==== icon:cog[] Performance Updates

* Disabled zone js, for faster front-end performance.
* Added a delay to non-critical backend calls such as; recently viewed, metadata, and notifications.

==== icon:cog[] Record Mappers

Record Mappers have been added to allow for more flexibility when extending SuiteCRM. They allow to add code for mapping a record to internal or to external format.

See the link:../../../../8.x/developer/extensions/backend/record-mappers/[Record Mappers] section for more information.

==== icon:cog[] Save Handlers

Save handlers are classes that allow the app to run code before or after saving a record. They are similar to the legacy before_save and after_save logic hooks.

See the link:../../../../8.x/developer/extensions/backend/save-handlers/[Save Handlers] section for more information.

==== icon:cog[] Field Logic Update

There are now 3 different types of `triggeringStatus`:

* onDependencyChange
** When the dependant field changes.
* onAnyLogic
** When anything happens (i.e. value update, rendering fields, saving etc...).
* onFieldInitialize
** When the Field is rendered (i.e. loading the recordview/ switching tabs on recordview).

SuiteCRM is now using Symfony v6.4 and Api Platform 3.2. This brings some system requirement updates and breaking changes.

**Minimum php version - PHP 8.1**

The minimum php version is now 8.1. PHP 7.4 stopped being supported since version 8.4.0 but the system would still run. From this release onwards PHP 7.4 will not work.

** For new installations a random APP_SECRET will be generated during the install process. For upgrades a migration has been added to generate a random APP_SECRET.

** SuiteCRM is now using Symfony runtime, core SuiteCRM code on index.php has been moved to `core/backend/Composer/Runtime/autoload_runtime.template`

* **Migration from annotations to attributes**
** Annotations have been replaced with attributes. They have been disabled in symfony configuration and the `doctrine/annotations` dependency has been removed.

* **Data Providers and Data Persisters have been deprecated**
** With Api Platform 3.2, Data Providers and Data Persisters have been replaced with StateProvider and StateProcessor.

** With Api Platform 3.2 the graphql response structure changed. E.g. response now return `recordList` attribute instead of `getRecordList`-.

* **Graphql resolver interfaces path has changed**

** Legacy handlers and loading of legacy imports have been updated to remove the need for doing session swapping. Only one session cookie will be used from now on, the `LEGACYSESSID` has been removed.

* **Symfony Commands now require the usage of AsCommand attribute**
** All core commands have been updated to use the new AsCommand attribute.

* **Session injectable dependency replaced with RequestStack**
** It is no longer possible to pass the `Session` through Symfony dependency injection, `RequestStack` should be used instead. Core code has been updated to support this.

* **Authentication configuration has been updated**

* **SAML dependency replaced and configuration updated**
** SAML `Hslavich` dependency has been replaced with `Nbgrp`.
** Base SAML configurations have been updated.
** New SAML env options have been added to allow configuring SAML just from the env files.

* **Usages of Doctrine DBAL execute method have been updated**

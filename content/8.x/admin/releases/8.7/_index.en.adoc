===  icon:check[] Release Notes

==== icon:level-up-alt[] Platform upgrade

SuiteCRM is now using Symfony v6.4 and Api Platform 3.2. This brings some system requirement updates and breaking changes.

==== icon:server[] System Requirement Changes

**Minimum php version - PHP 8.1**

The minimum php version is now 8.1. PHP 7.4 stopped being supported since version 8.4.0 but the system would still run. From this release onwards PHP 7.4 will not work.

**[development] Composer v2+ required**

Composer 1.x is no longer supported.

==== icon:code[] Configuration Changes

**SAML configuration has changed**

Authentication SAML has been updated, there are new configuration options available and most of the configuration can now be done on env files.

To see how to setup and configure the authentication methods, please see the following documentation:

** link:../../../../8.x/admin/configuration/saml/8.7.0-saml-configuration[SAML Configuration Reference]

==== icon:code[] Backward Incompatible Changes

* **APP_SECRET env property is now required**
** For new installations a random APP_SECRET will be generated during the install process. For upgrades a migration has been added to generate a random APP_SECRET.

* **Move to Symfony runtime**
** SuiteCRM is now using Symfony runtime, core SuiteCRM code on index.php has been moved to `core/backend/Composer/Runtime/autoload_runtime.template`

* **Migration from annotations to attributes**
** Annotations have been replaced with attributes. They have been disabled in symfony configuration and the `doctrine/annotations` dependency has been removed.

* **Data Providers and Data Persisters have been deprecated**
** With Api Platform 3.2, Data Providers and Data Persisters have been replaced with StateProvider and StateProcessor.

* **Graphql Record and RecordList API response structure updated**
** With Api Platform 3.2 the graphql response structure changed. E.g. response now return `recordList` attribute instead of `getRecordList`-.

* **Graphql resolver interfaces path has changed**
** All the resolvers have been updated to use the new `QueryItemResolverInterface`.

* **ExtensionAssetCacheWarmupDecorator has been replaced with an extra cache warmer**
** Symfony now supports adding extra warmers. The decorator has been replaced with an extra cache warmer.

* **Legacy Session swapping removed**
** Legacy handlers and loading of legacy imports have been updated to remove the need for doing session swapping. Only one session cookie will be used from now on, the `LEGACYSESSID` has been removed.

* **Symfony Commands now require the usage of AsCommand attribute**
** All core commands have been updated to use the new AsCommand attribute.

* **Session injectable dependency replaced with RequestStack**
** It is no longer possible to pass the `Session` through Symfony dependency injection, `RequestStack` should be used instead. Core code has been updated to support this.

* **Authentication configuration has been updated**

* **SAML dependency replaced and configuration updated**
** SAML `Hslavich` dependency has been replaced with `Nbgrp`.
** Base SAML configurations have been updated.
** New SAML env options have been added to allow configuring SAML just from the env files.

* **Usages of Doctrine DBAL execute method have been updated**
** Doctrine DBAL execute method has been deprecated, usages have been updated to use alternatives.

* **Log configurations updates**
** Log configurations have been re-factored to filter deprecations and split the deprecations and the security logs into separate files.

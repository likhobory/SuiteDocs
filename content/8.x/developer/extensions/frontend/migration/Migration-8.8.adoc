== 1. Intro

The following guide explains how to migrate extensions created in a version prior to SuiteCRM 8.8. So they can work on SuiteCRM 8.8+.

In SuiteCRM 8.8 angular version has been updated to v18. This brought some changes to the SuiteCRM setup.

⚠️ *Important*: SuiteCRM is still using Webpack and Module Federation. We will not be using esbuild and Native Federation for the time being.

== 2. Structure Changes

**Frontend common lib has been moved into core**

* `core/app/common` is now inside `core/app/core/src/lib/common/`.

**The angular.json file is now generated**

* `angular.json` is now a generated file and is no longer under version control.
* The angular.json file is not part of the base package, it should not be committed.
* Using the `yarn merge-angular-json` it is generated from `base-angular.json` and any extensions' `angular.json`.
* The `base-angular.json` is now under `core/angular/base-angular.json`.
* Each extension should have its own `angular.json` file.
** You can use the `angular.json` on defaultExt as a reference.

*Zone.js has been disabled*

* `zone.js` has been disabled (using provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection)

*Extension's webpack.config.js updated*

* ⚠️ *Important*: If using extensions please ensure to update extension configuration.

* Update `webpack.config.js`. (You can use the `webpack.config.js` on `defaultExt` as reference).

== 3. Command Changes

*Old yarn build:common removed*

* `yarn run build:common` is no longer needed.

*New yarn build added*

* `yarn build` can be run to build in production.
** `yarn build-dev` can be run to build in development.

*New yarn merge-angular-json added*

* New command `yarn merge-angular-json` added to merge all angular jsons from any extensions and core and merge them into the generated `angular.json`.


*New build:extension added*

* `yarn build:extension <extensions name>` to build an extension. e.g `yarn build:extension defaultExt`.
** Replaces `yarn build:<extension>`, e.g. `yarn build:defaultExt`.
** `yarn build-dev:extension <extensions name>` to build in development

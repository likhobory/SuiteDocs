{{% /notice %}}


== 1. Intro

The following guide explains how to migrate extensions created in a version prior to SuiteCRM 8.8. So they can work on SuiteCRM 8.8+.

In SuiteCRM 8.8 angular version has been updated to v18. This brought some changes to the SuiteCRM setup.

⚠️ *Important*: SuiteCRM is still using Webpack and Module Federation. We will not be using esbuild and Native Federation for the time being.

== 2. Structure Changes

**Frontend common lib has been moved into core**

* `core/app/common` is now inside `core/app/core/src/lib/common/`.

**The angular.json file is now generated**

* `angular.json` is now a generated file and is no longer under version control.
* The angular.json file is not part of the base package, it should not be committed.
* Using the `yarn merge-angular-json` it is generated from `base-angular.json` and any extensions' `angular.json`.
* The `base-angular.json` is now under `core/angular/base-angular.json`.
* Each extension should have its own `angular.json` file.
** You can use the `angular.json` on defaultExt as a reference.

*Zone.js has been disabled*

* `zone.js` has been disabled (using provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection)

*Extension's webpack.config.js updated*

* ⚠️ *Important*: If using extensions please ensure to update extension configuration.

* Update `webpack.config.js`. (You can use the `webpack.config.js` on `defaultExt` as reference).

== 3. Command Changes

*Old yarn build:common removed*

* `yarn run build:common` is no longer needed.

*New yarn build added*

* `yarn build` can be run to build in production.
** `yarn build-dev` can be run to build in development.

*New yarn merge-angular-json added*

* New command `yarn merge-angular-json` added to merge all angular jsons from any extensions and core and merge them into the generated `angular.json`.


*New build:extension added*

* `yarn build:extension <extensions name>` to build an extension. e.g `yarn build:extension defaultExt`.
** Replaces `yarn build:<extension>`, e.g. `yarn build:defaultExt`.
** `yarn build-dev:extension <extensions name>` to build in development

== 4. Steps to migrate the frontend extensions, including defaultExt

1. Update `node` and `yarn` to the versions specified on the compatibility matrix.
** You can check the compatibility matrix on the link:../../../../../admin/compatibility-matrix/[Compatibility Matrix] page.
2. Unzip the package on the SuiteCRM 8.8+ version to somewhere outside the SuiteCRM directory.
3. Update the config files on defaultExt. Copy the following files from the package to your instance.
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/angular.json`
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/karma.conf.js`
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/tsconfig.app.json`
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/tsconfig.spec.json`
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/tslint.json`
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/webpack.config.js`
** `extensions/defaultExt/app/webpack.prod.config.js`
4. Update the config files on your extension. Using defaultExt as a reference, update the following files.
** `extensions/<extension>/app/angular.json`
** `extensions/<extension>/app/karma.conf.js`
** `extensions/<extension>/app/tsconfig.app.json`
** `extensions/<extension>/app/tsconfig.spec.json`
** `extensions/<extension>/app/tslint.json`
** `extensions/<extension>/app/webpack.config.js`
** `extensions/<extension>/app/webpack.prod.config.js`
5. Update any references to the common lib used in extensions.
** defaultExt: `extensions/defaultExt/app/src`.
** Your extension: `extensions/<extension>/app/src`
** You can search on the imports for `from 'common'` and replace with `from 'core'`.
6. Update `extension.module.ts` on extensions
** defaultExt: `extensions/defaultExt/app/src/extension.module.ts`.
** Your extension: `extensions/<extension>/app/src/extension.module.ts`
** Use `extensions/defaultExt/app/src/extension.module.ts` from the new package as a reference.
7. Update `remoteEntry` inside `config/extension.php` and your extensions.
** defaultExt: `extensions/defaultExt/config/extension.php`.
** Your extension: `extensions/<extension>/config/extension.php`
** The value of `remoteEntry` has changed from `./extensions/<extension>/remoteEntry.js` to `../extensions/<extension>/remoteEntry.js`
8. Update your custom frontend code on `defaultExt` and your extensions to cope with any breaking changes.
9. Run `yarn merge-angular-json` to generate the `angular.json` file.
** This will generate the root `angular.json` file based on the `base-angular.json` and any extensions' `angular.json`.
** The `angular.json` file is not part of the base package, it should not be committed.
** This generated  `angular.json` is used by angular cli to build the main code and the extensions.
10. Build extensions using `yarn build:extension <extension>`.
** Build defaultExt: `yarn build:extension defaultExt`.
** Build your extensions: `yarn build:extension <extension>`.
11. ⚠️ You should not need to re-build the core frontend, as it should be updated during the upgrade.
** The only reason you would need to build core is if you have made changes to the core. Which we highly discourage.
** But if you really need, you can run `yarn build` to build the core. This should be done before building the extensions.

== 1. Introduction

Field actions allow you to add custom action buttons next to fields in SuiteCRM.

The clear field action allows to clear the field value by clicking a button.

This guide will walk you through the process of adding the clear field action to a field.

== 2.Logic Metadata definition

{{% notice note %}}
When making these changes be sure to make them in the custom directory, ie: 'public/legacy/custom/modules/<module>/...'
{{% /notice %}}

The first thing to define is the `fieldActions` entry in the metadata. This is where the action buttons for fields are defined.

The configuration for the actions can be added only to `detailviewdefs.php`.

In the following example we are going to add them to the `Accounts` module `detailviewdefs.php`.


=== 2.1 Steps to add the actions on the custom detailviewdefs.php

. Copy the core Accounts `detailviewdefs.php` to the custom folder:
.. From: `public/legacy/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
.. To: `public/legacy/custom/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`
. Add a new entry for your custom action button on the custom `detailviewdefs.php` with the code on the snippet below
** Re-set permissions if needed (will depend on your setup)
. Run `Repair and Rebuild` on Admin menu

=== 2.2 Action definition

The following were the changes applied in order to have the field action displaying.

                'labelKey' => 'LBL_CLEAR_BUTTON_LABEL',
                'modes' => ['edit'],
                'klass' => ['btn btn-sm btn-secondary p-1 m-0 ml-1'],
                'params' => [
                    'expanded' => true
                ]

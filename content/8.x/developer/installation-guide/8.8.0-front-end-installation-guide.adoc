Please make sure you have the same versions as the ones described on this section
{{% /notice %}}

Before you can start building extensions you first need to install the following software:

* npm
* yarn
* ng cli

Go to the link:../../../admin/compatibility-matrix/[Compatibility Matrix] page and check the specific versions under the `Additional requirements for Development` section for the SuiteCRM version you are using.

After installing everything, open a terminal on the SuiteCRM folder and run:

[source,bash]
----
ng --version
----

You should have an output similar to the following (except for the versions, that may change depending on the SuiteCRM version you are using):

=== 2. Install dependencies

{{% notice note %}}
You only need to do this step once. After the dependencies are installed you should only need to run it again after upgrading to a new SuiteCRM version
{{% /notice %}}

Now that the base system requirements are setup, you need to install the needed dependencies (node modules).

Go to your SuiteCRM folder on the terminal and run:

[source,bash]
----
yarn install
----

=== 3. Build core

{{% notice note %}}
You only need to do this step once. After the dependencies are installed you should only need to run it again after upgrading to a new SuiteCRM version
{{% /notice %}}

In order to build your extension you need to have the built versions of the frontend common, core and shell packages.

You can build the core front end by running the following commands. Please note that these need to be built sequentially in the order described below.

[source,bash]
----
yarn merge-angular-json
yarn build
----

You can run `core` and `shell` independently by running:

[source,bash]
----
yarn build:core
yarn build:shell

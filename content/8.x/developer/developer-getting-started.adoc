== 1. Intro

Before starting to develop your extensions you first need to setup a development environment. Since version 8.3.0 there are two ways to do this setup.

We recommend using the dev package that is available since version 8.3.0.

Alternatively you can setup an environment directly from the source code, without using any package.

=== 1.1 (recommended) Setting up using the development package

. Download the dev package from github, e.g.: `SuiteCRM-8.3.0-dev.zip`, see the dev package in the link:https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core/releases/latest[Latest GitHub Release]
. Install SuiteCRM using the link:../../admin/installation-guide/downloading-installing/[Downloading & Installing] guide from the admin section
. Setup the frontend extension using the link:./extensions/frontend/older/8x-fe-extensions-getting-started[Getting started with frontend extension development]


=== 1.2 (alternative) Setting up using the source code

Install from source using the link:../installation-guide/backend-end-installation-guide[Backend-end Developer Install Guide]

== 2. Understand how extensions work

The link:../extensions/extension-structure[Extension Structure] provide information about the extension structure and guidelines on how to build them.

== 3. Understand how the application is structured

The pages in the link:../architecture/[Architecture] section provide information on how the application is structured and how it works.

== 4. Examples

If you would like more documentation on building specific extensions. Please see the guides in link:../extensions/frontend/examples/[Front-end extension examples]

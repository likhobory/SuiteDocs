:imagesdir: /images/en/admin/email/microsoft

== 1. Intro

This guide will explain how to configure an inbound and outbound email connections using a previously configured OAuth Provider.

As example we will use a Microsoft account, however the steps should be similar for other providers

In this guide we will be configuring a personal account using a group OAuth Provider. Group OAuth providers are meant to be used by many users in the system.

As an admin you can create three types of records:

. Personal
.. These are only accessible by the user that created them
.. Personal records are meant to be used when configuring access to personal accounts, like 'john.doe@example-inc.onmicrosoft.com'.
.. These accounts configuration is only accessible by the account owner and system administrators
. Group
.. Records that will be used by many users
.. Group records are meant to be use by accounts in a domain that are meant to be used by several users, e.g. all members of the support team would have access to `support@example-inc.onmicrosoft.com`.
. Bounce (only on Inbound Email)
.. Records meant to be used just for reading Campaings bounce emails

Please be sure to use the same type of OAuth Provider as the type of account you are configuring. E.g. use a Group OAuth Provider to configure a Group Inbound/ Outbound Account.

== 2. Create an OAuth Connection

Login into you SuiteCRM instance

On the navbar global menu click on "Profile"
image:suitecrm-profile-link.png[suitecrm-profile-link.png]

On your "Profile" click on the "External OAuth Connection" sidebar menu entry.
image:suitecrm-oauth-connection-menu-link.png[suitecrm-oauth-connection-menu-link.png]

That should take you to the "External OAuth Connections" module list view

image:suitecrm-external-oauth-connection-list-view.png[suitecrm-external-oauth-connection-list-view.png]

This module is the one that will keep the reference of all the existing OAuth Connections. It stores the tokens generated after the authentication.

Lets create a new Personal OAuth Connection. click on "Personal OAuth Connection"

image:suitecrm-new-personal-oauth-connection-link.png[suitecrm-new-personal-oauth-connection-link.png]

This should take you to the creation view.

image:suitecrm-oauth-connection-create-blank.png[suitecrm-oauth-connection-create-blank.png]

Add a meaningful name to your connection, it can be the username of your account, or something that helps you identify and differentiate the connection from other existing connections.

image:suitecrm-oauth-connection-name-field.png[suitecrm-oauth-connection-name-field.png]

Now select on the "Provider" field, select the Microsoft OAuth Provider that you previously created.

image:suitecrm-oauth-connection-provider-field.png[suitecrm-oauth-connection-provider-field.png]

After selecting the provider it is time to authenticate, click on the "Authenticate" button.

image:suitecrm-oauth-connection-authenticate.png[suitecrm-oauth-connection-authenticate.png]

When clicking the button a popup window should display with the Microsoft page for Authentication.

image:microsoft-authenticate-popup.png[microsoft-authenticate-popup.png]

After going through all the authentication popup steps, the popup should close and the fields on the External OAuth Connection record should be populated.

{{% notice warning %}}
Do not store or share any of the tokens. These work almost as passwords. They are sensitive information.

The 3 different types of Auth Type here are:

. No Auth
.. This is the default type, it does not require any authentication. It is meant to be used when you are using a server that does not require authentication, like a local SMTP server.
. Basic Auth
.. This is the type to use when you are using a server that requires basic authentication, like a local SMTP server or a server that does not support OAuth.
. OAuth
.. This is the type to use when you are using a server that supports OAuth authentication, like Microsoft or Google accounts.

By selecting the OAuth type, the "External OAuth Connection" field should now display. Click on the arrow to select the OAuth Connection you created before.

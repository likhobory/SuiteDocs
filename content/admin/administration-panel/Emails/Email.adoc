== Mail Accounts Overview

Configuring email for *SuiteCRM* provides a wide range of features, including sending personal emails to
contacts, automatic creation of cases, sending notifications for events using
link:../../../../user/advanced-modules/workflow/[workflows] and sending email marketing
link:../../../../user/core-modules/campaigns/[campaigns].

This document explains the different types of mail accounts and how to set them up. For information
on reading and sending email in SuiteCRM using the Emails module, see the
link:../../../../user/core-modules/emails[Emails module guide].

Several different types of account can be configured within *SuiteCRM* for different purposes.
These are:

*Outgoing Mail*

The outgoing mail server is used to send automatic email notifications (such as record
assignment notifications) and emails sent as link:../../../../user/advanced-modules/workflow/[workflows]
 actions.

The outgoing mail configuration will need to be set up by an Administrator.

See <<Outgoing Mail Configuration>> for instructions on setting up the default outgoing mail
configuration.

Other outbound accounts can be configured in addition to the default account for specific purposes,
such as sending link:../../../../user/core-modules/campaigns/[Campaigns]. These can be set up from the
Admin panel, under outbound accounts. If no other outbound accounts are configured, the default
outgoing mail server account will be used.

*Personal Accounts*

A personal account is used to view and send email from a personal email account within the Emails
module. This account can be an internal or an external email account.
Emails from personal accounts are not stored in *SuiteCRM* unless manually imported.

Personal accounts can be configured by the user from their user profile. Administrators can configure
personal accounts for other users.

See link:../../../../user/introduction/managing-user-accounts[Managing User Accounts] for instructions on
setting up a personal account.

*Group Accounts*

Group accounts are used when you need several users to be able to view and send email from one mail
account, for example a support or sales mailbox. Group accounts can be set up to automatically import
emails and create link:../../../../user/core-modules/cases[Cases] from incoming email.

Group accounts must be set up by an Administrator. Access to a group account must be granted by an
Administrator.

Set up a group account from the <<Inbound Email>> page.

*Bounce Handling Accounts*

A Bounce Handling account is used with link:../../../../user/core-modules/campaigns/[Campaigns] to handle bounced
mail notifications when emails are undelivered. You will need to set up a Bounce Handling account in
order to send a Campaign.

Bounce Handling accounts must be set up by an Administrator. Once set up, users can select the bounce
handling account when setting up a campaign.

Set up a Bounce Handling account from the <<Inbound Email>> page.

== Email Settings

=== Outgoing Mail Configuration

The outgoing mail configuration settings are used to send system notification emails such as
password reset emails, record assignment notifications and
link:../../../../user/advanced-modules/workflow/[workflow] email notifications.

image:StandardEmailSettings.png[Outgoing Mail Configuration]

The account shown on Email Settings will now be the default system outbound email account.

|*Allow users to use this account for outgoing mail*|When this option selected, all users
will be able to send emails using this outgoing mail account, which is the same as that used
to send system notifications and alerts. If the option is not selected, users can still use the
outgoing mail server after providing their own account information.

 using the same outgoing mail account used to send system notifications and alerts.

 own account information.

which may assist with resolving the issue.

has the correct permissions to send mail.
